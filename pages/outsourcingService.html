            <h3>What Exactly Is Outsourcing?</h3>
            <p>
              Though it’s thrown around a lot on the news - typically when
              people are outsourcing jobs to foreign countries that could be
              done in the US - outsourcing is a simple concept: it’s when a
              business subcontracts out a portion of the company’s activities to
              a third-party. In other words, it’s performing a business endeavor
              outside of the organization. “Outsourcing involves subcontracting
              parts of a company's value-chain, (i.e. steps in the design,
              supply, production, marketing, sales, and services processes) to
              other companies or contractors that specialize in those
              activities. Through outsourcing agreements, the client company
              hires separate companies to perform specific tasks in the
              value-chain on its behalf. Often, the work is performed under the
              name of the client,” reports Investing Answers. “The kinds of
              outsourcing work performed vary widely across industry sectors.
              Some common outsourcing activities include: human resource
              management, facilities management, supply chain management,
              accounting, customer support and service, marketing, computer
              aided design, research, design, content writing, engineering,
              diagnostic services, and legal documentation.”

                <h3>Project-Based Outsourcing</h3>
                <p>
                  Projects can come in all shapes and sizes. For example, say
                  that you want to launch an ad campaign but do not have the
                  creative staff onboard right now to pull it off in-house.
                  Instead of starting an entire department for one project, it
                  makes sense to work with a third-party to contract out that
                  work. This is a good idea because you can find an ad agency
                  that are experts in their craft, making sure that you have
                  everything you need to succeed. Agencies like these are all
                  over the place, allowing you to have the pick of the litter.

                <h3>Outsourcing IT</h3>
                <p>
                  Whether it’s to develop a new app, maintain your current IT
                  infrastructure, or really anything else that has to do with
                  technology, companies all over the world have started to
                  outsource their IT needs to outside agencies. Why? Well, for
                  some, it’s a cheap way to ensure that servers keep running and
                  emails keep being delivered without the headache of managing -
                  and paying for - an entire department. When it comes to
                  development, outsourcing examples abound because, just like
                  the previous example, you can rely on expert teams to make the
                  product without needing to hire the right individuals to do so
                  in-house.

                <h3>The Professional Level</h3>
                <p>
                  Though IT can be considered inside this section, too, what
                  we’re talking about when we say ‘professional’ are the
                  departments such as HR, legal counselling, accounting,
                  payroll, etc. With a suite of different options to choose from
                  nowadays, many companies have started to have professional
                  assistance from outside companies. For example, payroll.
                  Payroll in today's world can be done using outside systems
                  that track money in and money out, allowing you to pay workers
                  on time, keep track of IRS documents, and things of that
                  nature so that you don’t have to.
